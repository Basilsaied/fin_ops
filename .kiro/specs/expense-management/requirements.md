4. WHEN I delete an entry THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database after confirmation
5. WHEN I perform any CRUD operation THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and update related visualizations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through an intuitive interface, so that I can efficiently access all application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application THEN the system SHALL display a home page with an overview dashboard showing the latest month's data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle data storage reliably, so that organizational expense data is preserved and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN expense data is submitted THEN the system SHALL store it in a relational database with proper data types and constraints
2. WHEN the database is queried THEN the system SHALL support at least 10 years of monthly expense data efficiently
3. WHEN data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity and prevent data corruption
4. WHEN the system processes requests THEN the database SHALL handle concurrent operations safely
5. WHEN backup operations are needed THEN the system SHALL support standard database backup and recovery procedures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide secure and well-structured APIs, so that data access is controlled and the application can be extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations
